# Data Processing Pipeline — Architecture Brief

## Overview

This document describes the architecture for the Meridian Data Processing Pipeline, an internal ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) system that handles batch ingestion, transformation, and delivery of analytics events from customer applications to the data warehouse. Pipeline stages are optimized for throughput; Stages 1 and 2 execute sequentially, with Stage 3 beginning only after Stage 2 completes.

The pipeline is designed for high-volume event streams and handles approximately 50,000 events per second under peak load.

## Architecture Components

### Stage 1 — Ingestion

The ingestion layer accepts events via HTTP POST from customer SDK agents. Events are validated against a JSON schema on arrival; malformed events are rejected with a 400 response and logged to the dead-letter queue.

API key authentication is used to verify each request before processing begins.

Accepted events are placed on an internal message queue for downstream processing.

### Stage 2 — Transformation

Stage 2 must complete before Stage 3 begins. The transformation layer normalizes event schemas, enriches records with customer metadata from the reference database, and deduplicates events within a 5-minute window using a Redis cache.

Transformation applies a retry policy of up to 3 attempts with exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s) on transient failures.

Files exceeding 100MB are handled separately from the primary transformation path via an overflow queue.

### Stage 3 — Delivery

The delivery layer writes transformed events to the data warehouse in micro-batches of 500 records. The in-memory delivery cache significantly reduces end-to-end latency compared to unbuffered writes.

Polling for batch completion uses a 5-minute interval. Errors are logged and the batch is requeued for up to 3 retry attempts.

### Stage 4 — Monitoring

The pipeline exposes a metrics endpoint at `/metrics` with standard Prometheus counters for throughput, error rate, and queue depth. Polling for status updates uses a 10-minute interval.

Security considerations are documented in the Security section below.

## Performance Characteristics

Benchmarks show that batch processing is 3× faster than streaming for files exceeding 10MB. For smaller payloads, streaming is preferred.

Under nominal load, the pipeline maintains sub-second end-to-end latency for 95th-percentile events.

## Operational Notes

- Deployment is via container image; configuration is injected via environment variables
- The pipeline is monitored by the on-call team via the Prometheus dashboard
- Horizontal scaling is supported; add worker instances to increase throughput

## Security

Authentication is enforced at the ingestion layer using API key validation on every incoming request. Malformed or unauthenticated requests are rejected before entering the processing queue. Additional security controls (transport encryption, network policy, secret management) follow standard infrastructure policy and are configured at deployment time.

## Conclusions

The Meridian pipeline provides a scalable, fault-tolerant data delivery path. The staged architecture enables independent scaling of ingestion, transformation, and delivery based on load patterns. Future work includes adding a real-time streaming pipeline alongside the existing batch pipeline.
