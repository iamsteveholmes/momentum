name: avfl
description: Adversarial Validate-Fix Loop (AVFL) — a research-backed multi-agent validation pipeline that catches errors, hallucinations, and quality issues in any AI-generated artifact. Use this skill whenever a user asks to "validate", "verify and fix", "run a quality pass", "check this output", or "review for quality" on a document, report, spec, code, or data artifact. Also use proactively at the end of any workflow that produces a critical deliverable — if the output matters, it should go through AVFL before being handed off. The skill runs parallel validation lenses (structural integrity, factual accuracy, coherence & craft, domain fitness), cross-checks findings between two independently-framed reviewers to filter hallucinations, scores issues by severity, and iteratively fixes until the output reaches a clean score (≥95/100) or exhausts iterations.

# AVFL — Adversarial Validate-Fix Loop

A multi-phase validation pipeline with parallel reviewers, cross-checked findings, and an iterative fix loop.

The framework is grounded in research: dual reviewers with different framings improve accuracy ~12% absolute over single-agent validation (Meta-Judge 2025). Staged validation is 8%+ more accurate and 1.5–5× more compute-efficient than outcome-only evaluation. Late-stage errors are 3.5× more damaging than early ones — which is why profile selection matters.

**This SKILL.md is the orchestration layer.** Before spawning your first subagents, read `references/framework.json` — it contains the complete dimension taxonomy, validator/consolidator/fixer prompt templates, finding schema, scoring weights, and usage examples. Use those prompts verbatim when instructing subagents.

## Parameters

Collect these before starting. If any are missing, ask before proceeding.

| Parameter | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `domain_expert` | Yes | — | The agent role that produced the output and will fix it (e.g., "technical writer", "software engineer", "analyst") |
| `task_context` | Yes | — | Brief description of what was produced (e.g., "market research report", "PRD section", "JSON config") |
| `output_to_validate` | Yes | — | The content or file path to validate |
| `source_material` | No | null | Ground truth to check against. Pass original source through the entire pipeline — never let intermediate steps compress it |
| `profile` | No | `full` | `gate`, `checkpoint`, or `full` |
| `stage` | No | `final` | Artifact maturity: `draft`, `checkpoint`, or `final`. Controls what absence counts as a gap — see Stage section below |

---

## Stage

Controls what absence counts as a finding — the maturity expectations for the artifact at the time of validation. Independent of `profile`.

| Value | Completeness expectation | When to use |
|---|---|---|
| `draft` | Expected gaps are not findings. Evaluate only what IS present — is it coherent and internally consistent? Do not penalize for sections not yet written. | Early-stage artifacts where incompleteness is intentional |
| `checkpoint` | Major sections must be present. Implementation details may still be incomplete. Flag major structural gaps; don't penalize missing fine-grained specs. | Mid-workflow artifacts where primary concerns should be addressed |
| `final` | All required sections must be complete. Flag all gaps. | Deliverables intended for handoff, human consumption, or downstream systems |

Default: `final`. When invoking AVFL from within a skill workflow, set `stage` to match the artifact's maturity at that workflow step.

---

## Skepticism

Controls how intensely reviewers search and their default assumption. The reviewer style describes HOW they read; skepticism describes HOW HARD they look.

| Level | Label | Approach | Re-examine if clean |
|---|---|---|---|
| `high` (3) | Aggressive | Look for what feels off. Follow hunches, then verify. Default assumption: something might be wrong. | Yes — once |
| `low` (2) | Balanced | Follow leads that seem promising. Give benefit of the doubt on borderline cases. | Optional |

**Skepticism is not a user parameter.** It is hardcoded by the pipeline:
- Iteration 1: `high` (3) — cast a wide net, maximize recall
- Iteration 2+: `low` (2) — verify fixes, catch regressions, don't re-litigate settled issues

Floor is `2`. Benchmarking showed skepticism=1 collapses Enumerator and Adversary to identical output, eliminating dual-review value entirely.

## Profiles

### gate
**When to use:** Input validation, format transitions, sanity checks between pipeline steps — anywhere you need a fast structural pass before continuing.

**How it runs:** 1 agent, structural lens only. No fix loop.
- Pass (score ≥ 95) → continue workflow
- Fail → halt and report GATE_FAILED. Cannot proceed until resolved.

### checkpoint
**When to use:** After the first interpretation step (errors here have 73% downstream propagation rate), at penultimate steps (3.5× more damaging than early errors), or after any irreversible narrowing decision.

**How it runs:** 1 agent per active lens (2–3 lenses relevant to the decision point). 1 fix attempt if issues found, then continue with CHECKPOINT_WARNING regardless.

### full
**When to use:** Final deliverables, high-stakes content, anything consumed by humans or downstream systems without further review.

**How it runs:** 2 agents per lens × 4 lenses = up to 8 parallel reviewers. Iterative fix loop (max 4 iterations, pass threshold 95/100).

## The Four Validation Lenses

Validators derive specific checks from their assigned dimensions based on the domain — the dimensions define WHAT to look for; the domain determines HOW.

**Lens 1 — Structural Integrity** (`structural`)
Mindset: Mechanical verification. Systematic, exhaustive, literal. Check every field, reference, and required element section by section.
Dimensions: structural_validity, completeness, cross_reference_integrity

**Lens 2 — Factual Accuracy** (`accuracy`)
Mindset: Fact-checker. Compare every claim against source material. Trust nothing — verify everything against ground truth.
Dimensions: correctness, traceability, logical_soundness

**Lens 3 — Coherence & Craft** (`coherence`)
Mindset: Editor. Read holistically as the intended audience would. Focus on whether the content works as a unified whole.
Dimensions: consistency, relevance, conciseness, clarity, tonal_consistency, temporal_coherence

**Lens 4 — Domain Fitness** (`domain`)
Mindset: Domain expert. Apply specialized knowledge — would a practitioner in this field accept this output and find it useful?
Dimensions: domain_rule_compliance, convention_adherence, fitness_for_purpose

For full dimension definitions, questions, common failure modes, and examples, see `references/framework.json` → `dimension_taxonomy`.

## Dual-Reviewer Framings (full profile only)

Each lens gets two reviewers with deliberately different reading styles. The diversity of approach is the mechanism — same-prompt reviewers capture far less benefit.

**Enumerator** — Systematic and methodical. Derives explicit checks from the dimensions, enumerates them, verifies each in order. Works through content section by section.

**Adversary** — Intuitive and pattern-aware. Reads holistically, looking for what feels off or inconsistent. Follows hunches, then verifies with evidence. Works across the full artifact, not section by section.

These styles describe HOW each reviewer reads. `skepticism` controls HOW HARD both reviewers look — it applies equally to both framings and is the primary lever for adjusting aggressiveness across iterations or workflow stages.

Cross-check confidence during consolidation:
- Both found it → **HIGH confidence** — almost certainly a real issue. Keep with highest severity from either reviewer.
- Only one found it → **MEDIUM confidence** — consolidator investigates against source material. Keep if evidence supports; discard if it appears to be a reviewer hallucination.

---

## Pipeline Execution

Read `references/framework.json` → `prompts` for the exact prompt templates to give each subagent type. Use those templates — they encode the calibration rules that make findings structured and evidence-backed.

### Role Configuration (Benchmarked Defaults)

Each role has a prescribed model and effort level derived from Phase 4 benchmarking (36 runs across 3 models × 3 effort levels × all roles). Use these — they represent measured optima, not guesses.

| Role | Model | Effort | Skill path | Rationale |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Enumerator validator | `sonnet` | `medium` | `avfl-validator-enum-medium` | Reliable recall; no false-pass risk |
| Adversary validator | `opus` | `high` | `avfl-validator-adv-high` | Best severity calibration; critical findings correctly classified |
| Consolidator | `haiku` | `low` | `avfl-consolidator-low` | Fully invariant across all model/effort combos — cheapest is sufficient |
| Fixer | `sonnet` | `medium` | `avfl-fixer-medium` | Handles both mechanical and generative fixes |

**How to apply:** When spawning subagents via the Agent tool, set the `model` parameter explicitly (`"sonnet"`, `"opus"`, `"haiku"`). Point the subagent at the appropriate skill path — the skill carries the `effort` frontmatter that overrides the session level.

**Do not use Haiku for Enumerator validators.** Benchmarking showed Haiku enum-medium produces false-pass scores (92/100 while missing a critical architectural contradiction) — the most dangerous failure mode.

**Do not use Sonnet for Adversary validators.** Benchmarking showed Sonnet Adversary systematically downgrades critical findings to high severity across all effort levels — a calibration defect that causes the pipeline to underreport severity.

---

### Phase 1: VALIDATE

Spawn validator subagents **in parallel** based on the profile. Set `model` and skill path per the Role Configuration table above.

- **gate:** 1 subagent — Enumerator framing, structural lens only. Model: `sonnet`.
- **checkpoint:** 1 subagent per active lens (2–3 lenses relevant to the step). Enumerator framing. Model: `sonnet`.
- **full:** 8 subagents total — 1 Enumerator + 1 Adversary per lens × 4 lenses, all in one turn. Enumerator: `sonnet`/medium. Adversary: `opus`/high.

Pass the current skepticism value explicitly in each subagent prompt: `high` (3) on iteration 1, `low` (2) on all subsequent iterations.

Each validator receives: lens definition, reviewer framing, skepticism level, and all parameters (`domain_expert`, `task_context`, `output_to_validate`, `source_material`). They produce findings in the finding schema — id, severity, dimension, location, description, evidence (mandatory), suggestion. Findings without evidence are hallucinations and get discarded.

### Phase 2: CONSOLIDATE

Run sequentially after all validators complete. Model: `haiku`. Skill: `avfl-consolidator-low`.

Use the consolidator prompt from `references/framework.json` → `prompts.consolidator`.

1. Tag each finding with confidence (HIGH / MEDIUM) — full profile only
2. Merge all findings from all lenses into one list
3. Deduplicate: same issue from multiple sources → keep most specific description and highest severity
4. Investigate MEDIUM-confidence findings against source material — keep if evidence supports, discard if reviewer hallucination
5. Remove any finding that lacks evidence
6. Calculate score: start at 100, apply: critical −15, high −8, medium −3, low −1
7. Sort by severity (critical first), then by location
8. Assign grade: ≥95 Clean, ≥85 Good, ≥70 Fair, ≥50 Poor, <50 Failing

### Phase 3: EVALUATE

Check exit conditions based on the profile:

**gate:** Score ≥ 95 → continue workflow. Score < 95 → halt, report GATE_FAILED.

**checkpoint:** Score ≥ 95 → continue. Score < 95 → proceed to one fix attempt, then continue with CHECKPOINT_WARNING regardless of result.

**full:** Score ≥ 95 → exit CLEAN. Score < 95 and iterations remaining → proceed to fix. Score < 95 and iteration = 4 → exit MAX_ITERATIONS_REACHED.

### Phase 4: FIX

Model: `sonnet`. Skill: `avfl-fixer-medium`. Use the fixer prompt from `references/framework.json` → `prompts.fixer`. Run as the `domain_expert` role.

- Fix in severity order: critical → high → medium → low
- Log each fix: finding ID → what was changed and why
- Do not introduce new problems while fixing
- When fixes conflict, resolve in favor of the higher-severity finding
- When ambiguous, stay closest to original source material
- Produce the complete corrected output, not just the changed sections

After fixing, loop back to Phase 1 with the updated output. **Always carry the original `source_material` forward unchanged** — validators at every iteration check against original ground truth, never intermediate representations.

**Critical:** Phase 1 in every iteration — including iteration 2+ — MUST spawn subagents. Do NOT validate the updated output inline, even if it is in context. Inline validation collapses the dual-reviewer cross-check that filters hallucinations. Spawn the same parallel subagent configuration as iteration 1 (with `low` skepticism for iterations 2+).

---

## Calibration Principles

These prevent both under-reporting (missed issues) and over-reporting (hallucinated findings). Remind validators of these when spawning them.

- **Evidence required** — every finding must quote the specific text, value, or section that is wrong. No evidence = discard.
- **Method over attitude** — systematic enumeration and verification, not adversarial hostility.
- **No quotas** — if the output is clean in your lens, say so. Whether to re-examine before reporting clean depends on skepticism level — see the skepticism instruction you received.
- **Scope discipline** — stay within your lens. Note out-of-scope issues briefly but don't deep-dive — another lens owns it.
- **Conservative flagging** — if you find evidence it's wrong, flag it. If you can't find evidence either way, don't flag it. Uncertainty is not a finding.
- **Severity honesty** — assign based on actual impact. Don't inflate severity to force failure or deflate to force a pass.

---

## Exit Reports

**CLEAN** — Score ≥ 95.
Report: status CLEAN, final score, iteration count, scores per iteration, total findings fixed.

**MAX_ITERATIONS_REACHED** — 4 iterations without reaching 95.
Report: status, final score, scores per iteration, remaining findings. Ask user to review and decide: accept as-is, manually fix, or adjust criteria.

**GATE_FAILED** — Gate profile failed.
Report: status, score, findings, pipeline stage name. Cannot continue until resolved.

**CHECKPOINT_WARNING** — Checkpoint didn't achieve clean after fix attempt.
Report: status, score, remaining findings, fix log. Continue with known issues flagged.
